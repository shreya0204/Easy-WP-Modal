# Easy_WP_Modal Features [![Project Status: Active ‚Äì The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

Plugin for Easy_WP_Modal. All backend functionality will take place in this plugin. Like, such as registering post type, taxonomy, custom blocks, and meta blocks.

## Get Started

### Plugin Setup

- Clone the `features-plugin-skeleton` repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/rtCamp/features-plugin-skeleton/) with the desired directory name using the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:rtCamp/features-plugin-skeleton.git <directory-name>
```

- Run `nvm use` to use the preferred Node.js version. It is highly recommended to use the Node version mentioned in the `.nvmrc` file to ensure building scripts run without failing.
- Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
  - After running the `npm install`, `npm run init` command will run the init script in interactive mode to initialize the plugin.
  - `npm:init` command is responsible for handling search-replace and Plugin cleanup.
  - If you don't want to run the init script, you can run `npm install --ignore-scripts` to install the dependencies without running the init script.
- Run `npm run init` to initialize the plugin anytime you want.

### Build Assets

- Use `npm start` to build the plugin assets in interactive mode.
- Use `npm run build:dev` or `npm run build:prod` to build the plugin assets in a non-interactive mode for Development and Production environments respectively.
- There are some additional commands available for building the assets separately:
  - `npm run start:blocks`: Builds the blocks assets only in interactive mode within `assets/src/blocks` directory.
  - `npm run start:js`: Builds the JavaScript assets only in interactive mode within `assets/src/js` directory.
  - `npm run build:blocks`: Builds the blocks assets only within `assets/src/blocks` directory.
  - `npm run build:js`: Builds the JavaScript assets only within `assets/src/js` directory.

### Run Linters and CS

- Use `npm run lint` to lint the plugin assets.
- Use `npm run lint:php`, `npm run lint:js` and `npm run lint:css` to lint the PHP, JavaScript and CSS files respectively.
- Use `npm run lint:php:fix`, `npm run lint:js:fix` and `npm run lint:php:fix` to lint the PHP, JavaScript or CSS files respectively and automatically fix the issues that are auto-fixable.
- There are linting commands available for `package.json` and `lint-staged` files:
  - `npm run lint:package-json`: Lints the package.json file.
  - `npm run lint:staged`: Lints the staged files.
- Used Linters and CS:
  - `stylelint`: Lints the CSS files.
  - `eslint`: Lints the JavaScript files.
  - `phpcs/phpcbf`: Lints the PHP files.

### Run Tests

- Use `npm run test` to run the plugin tests.
- WP PHPUnit tests are run inside the docker container using [wp-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/env) package.
- wp env Usage:
  - `npm run wp-env start`: Starts the wp env docker container.
  - `npm run wp-env start -- --xdebug`: Starts the wp env docker container with Xdebug enabled.
  - `npm run wp-env start -- --xdebug=debug,coverage`: Starts the wp env docker container with Xdebug enabled in debug and coverage mode.
  - `npm run wp-env stop`: Stops the wp env docker container.
- Use `npm run test:js` and `npm run test:php` to run the JavaScript or PHP unit tests respectively.
- Use `npm run test:php:coverage` to run the PHP unit tests with coverage. Before using this command, make sure to run wp env with xdebug coverage mode using `npm run wp-env start -- --xdebug=coverage` command.
- Tests suites:
  - `js`: JavaScript unit tests using `jest`.
  - `php`: PHP unit tests using WP PHPUnit.

### Working with PHPUnit Tests

This plugin is configured with WP PHPUnit tests out of the box. The tests are run inside the docker container using [wp-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/env) package. There can be chances when you need to run test cases with the different matrix of PHP, WP, and WP PHPUnit versions. To do that, you can override the default `.wp-env.json` file with `.wp-env.override.json` which is not included in your version control.

For example, you can use the following configuration to run the tests with PHP 7.4, WP 5.6, and WP PHPUnit 5.7:

```json
{
	"core": "WordPress/WordPress#5.6",
	"phpVersion": "7.4",
	"mappings": {
		"../wordpress-develop": "WordPress/wordpress-develop#5.7"
	}
}
```

Since wp env supports xdebug coverage mode, you can generate the coverage report for the tests on your local using `npm run test:php:coverage`. To do that, you need to run wp env with xdebug coverage mode using `npm run wp-env start -- --xdebug=coverage` command. After running the tests, you can find the coverage report in `coverage` directory.

> While running for test coverage in CI we suggest using `pcov` driver instead of `xdebug` driver to generate reports in less time in comparison to `xdebug` driver.

### Pre-commit Hook

- Support for two types of pre-commit hooks has been added:
  - Husky-based: `husky` package is used to run the pre-commit hook.
  - Bash Script-based: A bash script is added in `.git/hooks/pre-commit` directory.
- Use `npm run install:husky` or `npm run remove:husky` to install or remove the Husky pre-commit hook.
- Use `npm run install:pre-commit-hook` or `npm run remove:pre-commit-hook` to install or remove the bash script-based pre-commit hook.
  **Note:** If you are switching from husky to bash script-based pre-commit hook, you need to remove `hooksPath = .husky` from `.git/config` file.

### Extend Webpack Configuration

- Blocks are using [@wordpress/scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/scripts) Webpack configuration so no need to extend Webpack configuration for blocks.
- `assets/src/js` directory is using custom Webpack configuration extended from `@wordpress/scripts` Webpack configuration, so you need to specify entry point for the JavaScript files in `assets/src/js` directory.
- To add more JavaScript files to the Webpack configuration, you can use the following syntax:

```js
// If you have an example.js file in the `assets/src/js` directory, you can add it to the Webpack configuration like this:
const exampleJS = {
	...sharedConfig,
	entry: {
		example: path.resolve(process.cwd(), "assets", "src", "js", "example.js"),
	},
};

// If you want to add a plugin for this specific JS file, you can use the following syntax:
const exampleJS = {
	...sharedConfig,
	entry: {
		example: path.resolve(process.cwd(), "assets", "src", "js", "example.js"),
	},
	plugins: [...sharedConfig.plugins, new Plugin()],
};

// Similarly you can modify the webpack configuration for a entry point.

// Now you need to export the webpack configuration like this:
module.exports = [
	// ... more webpack configurations ...
	exampleJS,
];
```
